# Smart-Agriculture-system

This repository hosts the implementation of a smart agriculture system to help farmers and improve crops by identifying potential insect/pest attacks and monitoring the crop quality. The entire implementation is done leveraging a serverless architecture to ensure better scalablity and quick response. 

Serverless architecture is the future of cloud computing without having to worry about managing and deploying severs in the field of iot. 

Serverless computing offers a number of advantages over traditional cloud-based or server-centric infrastructure. For many developers serverless architectures offer
1. Greater scalability
2. More flexibility
3. quicker time to release

all at a reduced cost. With serverless architectures, developers do not need to worry about purchasing, provisioning, and managing backend servers. However, serverless computing is not a magic bullet for all web application developers.
